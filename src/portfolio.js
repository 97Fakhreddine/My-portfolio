    "Hello, world! I am Fakhreddine Messaoudi from Tunisia and I am currently working as a Full-stack developer at Edorer, and graduated from a Coding RebootKamp powered by Hack Reactor. I create content in design and development using different libraries and frameworks such as Angular, React, Vue.js, Node.js, Nest.js, etc. I have a background in Civil Engineering. When I am not developing, you can find me learning things on YouTube, writing articles, or at the gym. But most of my days are spent working on projects and developing new features and learning as much as I can. Feel free to contact me :)",
